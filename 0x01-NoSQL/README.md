**README: Backend Development with MongoDB (NoSQL)**

## Introduction

Welcome to the Backend Development with MongoDB (NoSQL) repository! This README provides a comprehensive guide to understanding the backend development processes and practices using MongoDB as the NoSQL database. MongoDB is a popular, open-source NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. This repository aims to help you master the fundamentals of working with MongoDB in backend applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **MongoDB:** Install MongoDB on your system. You can download it from the [official MongoDB website](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

## Repository Structure

- **`/src`:** Contains backend source code files.
- **`/models`:** Includes MongoDB schema and model files.
- **`/routes`:** Contains route handling files.
- **`/config`:** Configuration files for MongoDB connection setup.
- **`/tests`:** Unit tests for backend API endpoints.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd backend-mongodb
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure MongoDB:**
   - Create a MongoDB database.
   - Update the MongoDB connection string in `/config/database.js` with your MongoDB URI.

4. **Start the Server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will run at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations:** Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations with MongoDB.
- **Schema Design:** Design MongoDB schemas for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **RESTful APIs:** Build RESTful APIs for interacting with MongoDB data.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms for database operations.
- **Testing:** Write unit tests for backend APIs using testing frameworks like Mocha and Chai.
